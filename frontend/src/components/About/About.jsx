                    I am AKHILA U, UI/UX Designer with 6 months of hands-on experience
                    designing user-focused digital products across mobile and web platforms.

                    I specialize in wireframing, prototyping, usability testing,
                    and design systems using tools like Figma and Adobe XD.
                    I enjoy transforming complex requirements into simple,
                    scalable, and visually consistent interfaces.
